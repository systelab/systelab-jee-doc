# Code Conventions

The purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance on building Java applications while standarizing some conventions that we have decided to use. 

In general, the convention that it is suggested to follow is the one specified by Oracle in the document [Java Code Convention](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf).
